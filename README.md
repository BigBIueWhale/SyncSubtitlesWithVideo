# SyncSubtitlesWithVideo
# Written by Ronen Zyroff in 2020
Mathematical formula implemented in Python to fix stretched-out and time-shifted subtitles.
This program doesn't actually change the subtitle file, it simply tells the user by how much to multiply all timestamps and then by how much to add or subtract to all timestamps in the subtitle file. That can be done using a specialized program such as Aegisub.
Written in Python 3.
